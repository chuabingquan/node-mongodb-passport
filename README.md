# node-mongodb-passport
Based on Dr Muppala's NodeJS Coursera Course. 
https://www.coursera.org/learn/server-side-development

1. MongoDB credentials are stored in config.js
2. Middlewares are mainly instantiated in app.js
3. Web APIs are stored in the routes folder
4. Mongoose Models are stored in the Models folder
5. Used callback functions during the course, would strongly recommend the use of promises, generators or async/await.
